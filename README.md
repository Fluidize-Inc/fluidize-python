**Open Foundation for AI-Driven Scientific Computing**

Fluidize library provides the foundational types and abstractions for building and executing AI-orchestrated scientific computing pipelines. This allows agents to automatically orchestrate, configure, and iterate through computational pipeline with minimal prompting.

Fluidize is a Python library that establishes a standard for AI-orchestrated scientific computing. With this common framework, agents can automatically build, configure, and run computational pipelines across different domains and platforms.


**The Problem**

Students and researchers face significant barriers while translating their ideas into production ready pipelines:

-
- Time spent on software engineering instead of research

---

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- Docker (for local execution)

### Install from PyPI

```bash
pip install fluidize
```

### Development Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fluidize-Inc/fluidize-python.git
cd fluidize-python
make install
```

---

### Basic Usage

```python
from fluidize import FluidizeClient

client = FluidizeClient()

# Create a new project
project = client.projects.create(name="My Project")

# Load a project
loaded_project = client.projects.get(project_id=project.id)

# Run Project
loaded_project.run.run_flow()

```
