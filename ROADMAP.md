# Roadmap

This is just the beginning of what we think is a really exciting new era for how we learn science and do research. We will be releasing the following tools built from this framework:

- **Fluidize Playground**: Automatically explore and build simulation pipelines with natural language.
- **Auto-Fluidize**: Automatically convert obscure scientific software to run anywhere
