**Open Foundation for AI-Driven Scientific Computing**

Fluidize library provides the foundational types and abstractions for building and executing AI-orchestrated scientific computing pipelines. This allows agents to automatically orchestrate, configure, and iterate through computational pipeline with minimal prompting.

Fluidize is a Python library that establishes a standard for AI-orchestrated scientific computing. With this common framework, agents can automatically build, configure, and run computational pipelines across different domains and platforms.


**The Problem**

Students and researchers face significant barriers while translating their ideas into production ready pipelines:

-
- Time spent on software engineering instead of research



**Solution**

We devised a wrapper


Here are the building blocks.


Nodes: These are the foundational building blocks for Fluidize. It comes with the minimal set of information to run the simulation with no required modification for the source code itself. It is modular and easily easily extensible.

- Consistent and predictable input and output path for all simulations
- An arbitrary complicated scientific computing software to be be run with a single API endpoint.



 Here are the information specified on the nodes (More Could be put in documentation?)

- Properties.yaml - This tells the container image link, the working directory for the simulation running in the container, and where the output path is.

- Metadata.yaml - This provides more context on what the node is, including description, version, authors, and the repository URL it came from.

- Dockerfile - This provides the setup instructions for simulation runs

- Parameters.json - This is where you put your parameters you would like to tune during your experiments.

- main.sh - This is the script that executes your source code.

- source/ - This is where the source code is.

The good news is that we can automate the generation of these nodes.

Projects: Projects are a way of orchestrating nodes.

- graph.json - Graph specifiying how nodes are connected. It allows orchestration of generated nodes.
- metadata.yaml - This provides more context on what the project does.

More information on each of these files can be found in the documentation.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- Docker Desktop (for local execution)
  Download and install Docker Desktop (version 20.10+) from https://docs.docker.com/desktop/.
  After installation, verify with:
  ```bash
  docker --version
  ```
  Ensure the Docker daemon is running before using Fluidize.

### Install from PyPI

```bash
pip install fluidize
```

### Development Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fluidize-Inc/fluidize-python.git
cd fluidize-python
make install
```

---

### Basic Usage

```python
from fluidize import FluidizeClient

client = FluidizeClient()

# Create a new project
project = client.projects.create(name="My Project")

# Load a project
loaded_project = client.projects.get(project_id=project.id)

# Run Project
loaded_project.run.run_flow()

```
